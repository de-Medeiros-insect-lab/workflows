# Installing BEAST2 with GPU support

[BEAST2](https://www.beast2.org) can run much faster with a GPU, which requires a [BEAGLE](https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib) library compiled with GPU support. This is not the version that you can currently install with [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org), so here we will show how to install the requirements with Anaconda and then compile and install BEAGLE to you conda environment.

Currently (2023) the only GPU server at the Field Museum is CHANDLER, so these instructions will only work there
