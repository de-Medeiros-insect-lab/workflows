# Workflows

Here we have a collection of markdown files and scripts showing how to run some programs in the Field Museum servers. Check with the Grainger Bioinformatics Center about getting access to the servers and the configuration of each one. They provide this helpful document with set up and installation instructions: <https://felixgrewe.github.io/linux_cookbook/>

The repository is organized in three folders:

 * [initial_setup](initial_setup/): tips for setting up the servers, such as installing Anaconda, setting up terminal colors, etc
 * [install_instructions](install_instructions/): installation instructions for specific programs, especially those that use a GPU:
   * [BEAST2](install_instructions/BEAST2_with_GPU_support.md)
 * [running_jobs](running_jobs/): instructions and best practices on how to run jobs in the Field Museum servers, with example scripts for some programs.
 
 This is and will always be a work in progress, with more information added as we expand the scope of the work in the lab.
